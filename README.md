# Chandigarh Home Price Predictor

## Project Overview
The Chandigarh Home Price Predictor is a web application that leverages machine learning to accurately predict the prices of houses in Chandigarh, India. This project aims to empower both individual buyers and real estate companies with data-driven insights, promoting transparency and fairness in the local housing market.

## Key Objectives
1. **Protect Buyers**: Ensure that buyers are not overcharged by unscrupulous agents and get a fair deal on their home purchases.
2. **Assist Real Estate Companies**: Provide accurate price predictions to help real estate companies set appropriate listing prices, saving them time and money.
3. **Maintain Market Transparency**: Contribute to a more transparent real estate market by ensuring that prices are based on objective data rather than speculation.

## Features
- **Price Prediction**: Users can input property details (location, area, number of bedrooms, etc.) and receive a predicted price for the house.
- **Historical and Future Price Trends**: The application displays visualizations of historical price trends and forecasted future prices to aid decision-making.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Users can interact with a conversational chatbot to ask questions, receive information, and get price predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data preprocessing, model development, and backend implementation.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the web application.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for training and evaluating the price prediction model.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis libraries.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For building the chatbot functionality using a pre-trained natural language processing model.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: For building the user interface of the web application.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository from the GitHub repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Prepare the necessary data files (train.csv, historical_price_trends.csv, future_price_predictions.csv) and place them in the project directory.
4. Run the Flask application by executing `python app.py`.
5. Access the web application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Future Enhancements
- **Expand Data Sources**: Incorporate additional data sources, such as demographic information, infrastructure development, and economic indicators, to improve the model's predictive accuracy.
- **Implement Advanced Modeling**: Explore more sophisticated machine learning techniques, such as deep learning or ensemble methods, to further enhance the price prediction capabilities.
- **Provide Personalized Recommendations**: Develop features that can provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and budget.
